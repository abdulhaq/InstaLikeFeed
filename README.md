<p>Few weeks back, I showed you how you can create profile similar to Instagram? You can see that article <a href="http://it.haq.life/blog/115-android-instagram-like-profile">here</a>. 
Today I will show you, how you can create feed similar to Instagram?<br />
<br /><br />
<strong>Features:<br /></strong><ul><li><strong>Circular profile picture</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Clickable profile name: </strong>(You will have to edit code to make it work accounding to your needs).</li>
<li><strong>Post time.</strong></li><li><strong>Feed Image: </strong>(Its height automatically adjusts according to image size).</li></ul>
<br />Here is how end result will look like:<br /><img style="max-width: 617px;" src="http://haq.life/media/blog/blog-122-1.jpg" alt="" width="617" height="645" /><br />
